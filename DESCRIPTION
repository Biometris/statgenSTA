Description: Phenotypic analysis of field trials using mixed models with and 
    without spatial components. One of a series of statistical genetic packages 
    for streamlining the analysis of typical plant breeding experiments developed
    by Biometris.    
    Some functions have been created to be used in conjunction with the R 
    package 'asreml' for the 'ASReml' software, which can be obtained upon 
    purchase from 'VSN' international (<http://www.vsni.co.uk/software/asreml-r>).
